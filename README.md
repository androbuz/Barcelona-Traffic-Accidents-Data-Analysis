# (Barcelona Traffic Accidents Exploration)
## by (Andric Ishami)


## Dataset
>his dataset is a dataset provided publicly by the authorities of the city of Barcelona; It consists of yearly observations of accidents that took place in Barcelona from 2010 to 2021.

> This dataset includes 13 numeric variables and 14 string objects/categorical variables. From the numerical variables in this dataset, only 4 of them are usable for analysis; those are: n_deaths, n_vehicles, n_victims, n_wounded_severe and n_wounded_mild.There are 4 time features that are my main features of interest; month, time of day, hour and season.

## Summary of Findings
> During my explorations, I have found along the way that whatever month or season Barcelona is in, most of the accidents were recorded in the afternoon (precisely at 3pm) with July recording the most of these accidents. I also saw that the spring records a somehow clear pattern of high number of deaths and that we can expect the pattern to continue in the coming year(s). I also noticed that, interestingly, every start and end of month is where most of the accidents get recorded. And I also found that it's at night that many deaths of a single accident and the same night time that we observe big accidents (involving sometimes up to 7 cars). 



## Key Insights for Presentation

> In this presentation, I will be focusing mainly on the influence time (that is month, day, hour, season or year) to show the quantity and dimension of accidents happening in Barcelona.

> I will first show the distribution or dispersion of accidents in hours and then in months and later on, in years. It will be important to start from there because I will be introducing the seasons to show how they also influence the accidents that happened in Bracelona in the last 10 years. At last, I will look at the yearly growth, decline or any change whatsoever to see if we can predict the number of accidents to come in the following years.
